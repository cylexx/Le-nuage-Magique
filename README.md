### Project summary ###

"Le Nuage Magique" is a little web site project merging several cloud services. All you have to do is logging in the different supported cloud services and go on! 

For this first version, you can:

* Get informations of your files from your clouds accounts on a single place
* Upload new files
* Rename your files
* Create folders
* Move files and folders
* See the storage informations for each cloud connected
